# Sentiment-Analysis-for-tweets
Sentiment Analysis of tweets using lexicon bag of words model and Convolutional Neural Networks 

Glove file used: https://www.kaggle.com/watts2/glove6b50dtxt

### Requirements:
* sknn (Scikit Neural Networks)
* Global Vector Encoder (GloVe)/ Word to Vector Encoder (Word2Vec)
* Scipy (And its dependency packages)
* Numpy
* Tweepy (For Twitter data scraping)

### Usage:
Put in the glove and SSTb folders in each of the four model folders, then run python sentiment_xx.py
to run the default training session save the model to "sentiment_model.pkl".

### About the training set:
* 11976 phrases from the Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset or "SSTb". 
* Every phrase is encoded into a representative matrix with dense 50 dimensional GloVe embeddings. 
* The module sets a fixed limit of  15 words per sentence to ensure that the embedding matrix of sentences have a uniform dimension of 15X50.

### Description:
Sentiment analysis aims to determine the attitude of a speaker, writer, or other subject with respect to some topic or
the overall contextual polarity or emotional reaction to a document, interaction, or event. It determines whether a piece of writing is positive,
negative or neutral.
Sentiment analysis is extremely useful in social media monitoring as it allows us to gain an overview of the wider public opinion behind
certain topics. 

## 1. Lexicon Model: 

This could be considered as a modified Bag-Of-Words model, and the
modification being the consideration of context in the sentences. Primarily
the context generated by the preceding words/phrases are taken into
consideration. Then we begin by constructing a list inspired by examining
existing well-established sentiment word-banks (we used an existing
lexicon dictionary). To this, we next incorporate numerous lexical features
common to sentiment expression in microblogs, including a full list of
Western-style emoticons (for example, “:-)” denotes a “smiley face” and
generally indicates positive sentiment), sentiment-related acronyms and
initialisms (e.g., LOL and ROFL are both sentiment laden initialisms), and
commonly used slang with sentiment value (e.g., “nah”, “meh” and
“giggly”). The Lexicon dictionary we used collected intensity ratings on
each of the candidate lexical features from ten independent human raters
(for a total of 90,000+ ratings). Features were rated on a scale from
“Extremely Negative” to “Extremely Positive”, with allowance for “Neutral
(or Neither, N/A)”.
